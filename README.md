> *I use Arch btw... and I automate everything btw*

Welcome to my collection of scripts that make life on Arch Linux smoother than a freshly compiled kernel! 🚀

## 🤔 What's This All About?

You know that feeling when you've just finished a fresh Arch install and think "I should automate this"? Yeah, me too. That's what this repo is for.

This is my personal arsenal of bash scripts that solve real problems, automate boring tasks, and generally make my Arch life less painful and more productive. Because who has time to do things manually when you can spend 3 hours writing a script to automate a 5-minute task? 😎

## 📜 The Scripts

Each script here has one job: **make your life easier**. 

Whether it's optimizing your system, managing packages, automating backups, or just flexing that you use Arch (btw), these scripts are battle-tested on real Arch systems (mine).

### Current Arsenal:
- **Arch Linux Mirror & System Optimization** - Automatically finds the fastest mirrors and optimizes your system for speed


- **multi-github-arch-way** - Multi-account SSH setup for Arch Linux. Because you have commitment issues with GitHub accounts.


- *(More scripts coming as I procrastinate on actual work...)*

## 🎯 Philosophy

- **Simple**: No bloat, just solutions
- **Practical**: Solves actual daily problems
- **Documented**: Because future me will forget how this works
- **Open Source**: Share the automation love

## 🚀 How to Use

Each script lives in its own folder with a dedicated README that tells you exactly what it does and how to use it. Just browse, pick what you need, and follow the instructions in that folder.

**Pro tip:** Read the README before running anything. Yes, even you, speed-runner.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts work on MY Arch system. They SHOULD work on yours too, but:
- Always read the code before running
- Test in a VM if you're paranoid (smart)
- Backups are your friend
- I'm not responsible if you `rm -rf /` yourself

## 🎖️ The Arch Way

Remember: These scripts are meant to enhance your Arch experience, not replace the learning process. 

Read the wiki. Understand what the scripts do. Then automate it like a boss.
